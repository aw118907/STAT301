#Since only one of five possible answers is correct, 
the probability of answering a question correctly by random is 1/5=0.2. We can find
the probability of having exactly 4 correct answers by random attempts as follows.
12 questions
Each question- 5 option- 1 correct answer
Fing the probability of having four or less correct answers???????????

dbinom(4, size=12, prob=0.2)
